Description: # What is Ivy Memory?
        
        Ivy memory provides differentiable memory modules, including learnt
              modules such as Neural Turing Machines (NTM), but also parameter-free modules such as End-to-End Egospheric
              Spatial Memory (ESM). Ivy currently supports Jax, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and Numpy.
