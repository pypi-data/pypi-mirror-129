"""
A melded crawler and scraper which acts as the head of the data pipeline of Airbnb's product data scraping. 
Utilises the powerful tools of Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 to safely navigate and collect data from the website, 
without the use of an API.

        """A Webscraper that crawls through Airbnb's website and gathers structured/unstructured data.

        When an instance of Scraper is initialized, a Selenium Webdriver gets the homepage by use
        of the `url` attribute. Then it clicks past the cookie wall (if applicable), and navigates onto
        the main products hub.

        Parameters
        ----------
        slow_internet_speed : bool, default=False
            The crawler is designed to allow for lag whilst loading elements on a page, but users with a 
            particularly slow internet speed may cause the crawler to miss elements. A `slow_internet_speed` flag
            allows those users to still enjoy the potential of the scraper. It is not recommended to run the full
            scraper `scrape_all()` with `slow_internet_speed` enabled. This will take > 12 hours.
        config : str, defualt = 'default'
            Option to confiigure the selenium webdriver to operate in 'headless' mode or 'default' mode.
        messages : bool, default=False
            Option to activate messages of each successful item saved by the scraper, and any errors if applied.

        Attributes
        ----------
        BATCH_ATTEMPTS : int
            It is common that a Scraper can fail to find an element on a webpage for numerous reasons,
            for example that the element hasn't been loaded yet. `BATCH_ATTEMPTS` allows for this and 
            offers up to 25 attempts for the Scraper to locate and pull data from each element it is looking 
            for, until the Scraper assumes that the element doesn't exist in the particular page. If 
            `slow_internet_speed` is enabled, the attempts limit is increased to 50.
        main_url : str
            The URL for Airbnb's home page, provided for the Selenium webdriver to get upon initialization
            of the Scraper object.
        driver : Selenium Webdriver
            The webdriver that is utilized to crawl through Airbnb's website
        slow_internet_speed : bool
