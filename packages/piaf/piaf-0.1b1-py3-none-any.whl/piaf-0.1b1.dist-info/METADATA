The aim of piaf is to provide a FIPA-compliant agent framework using Python. It uses **asyncio** to power agents.

## Project status

**Piaf reached the beta status!** Now is time to polish the existing code, meaning that we don't plan to add huge features like FIPA SL for the 0.1 official release.

Although piaf made some progress lately, it still needs some love to be fully compliant with the [FIPA specification](http://fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html).

We provide some examples to help you understand what is possible to create with the current version, take a look at <https://gitlab.com/ornythorinque/piaf/-/tree/master/src/piaf/examples>.

### Supported features

- AMS (partial, only the query function)
- DF
- Communications within a platform
- Communications between two **piaf platforms** (with some limitations)

### Missing features

- FIPA SL support (only plain Python objects are supported)
- Federated DF
- Name resolution
- "Official" envelope representations (XML, bit-efficient) and MTPs (mainly HTTP, we don't plan to support IIOP)

## Documentation

The full documentation (both user and API) is available here: <https://ornythorinque.gitlab.io/piaf>
It will teach you how to install and run your own agents.
