# Quality LAC Data Reference - Postcodes

This is a redistribution of the **ONS Postcode Directory** shaped
to be used in the Quality Lac Data project.

This repository contains PyPI and npm distributions of
subsets of this dataset as well as the scripts to
generate them from source.

To keep distribution small, only pickled dataframes compatible 
with pandas 1.0.5 are included. This will hopefully change
once we figure out how to do different versions as extras.

As pickle is inherently unsafe, the SHA-512 checksum for each file
is included in [hashes.txt](qlacref_postcodes/hashes.txt). This
file is signed with [this key](./id_rsa.pub). 

When downloading from PyPI, specify the environment variable
`QLACREF_PC_KEY` to either be the public key itself, or a path
to where it can be loaded from. The checksums are then verified
and each file checked before unpickling. 

## Regular updates

When a new postcode distribution is available, download it and add it to the source folder and
at the same time delete the existing file from this location. There can only be one file
in the source folder at a time.

After updating the postcode sources, run the script found in `bin/generate-output-files.py` to 
regenerate the output files for each letter of the alphabet. These end up in the 
qlacref_postcodes directory.

To sign the postcodes, you need the distribution private key. Run the script `bin/sign-files.py` to
create the signed checksum file. 

Commit everything to GitHub. If ready to make a release, make sure to update the version in 
[pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml), push to GitHub and then create a GitHub release. The 
[GitHub Action](.github/workflows/python-publish.yml) will then create the distribution files and
upload to [PyPI][pypi].

Release naming should follow a pseudo-[semantic versioning][semver] format:
`<YEAR>.<MONTH>.<PATCH>`. Alpha and beta releases can be flagged by appending 
`-alpha.<number>` and `-beta.<number>`. 

For example, the August 2021 release is named [2021.8][2021.8] with the associated tag [v2021.8][tag-v2021.8].
