# cloudwatch-auto-retention

![release](https://github.com/stroobants-dev/cloudwatch-auto-retention/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cloudwatch-auto-retention.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cloudwatch-auto-retention)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cloudwatch-auto-retention.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cloudwatch-auto-retention)

cdk-cloudwatch-logs-auto-retention is an AWS CDK construct library that will check once a month if you have any Cloudwatch Log Groups in the region it is deployed with a never-expire retention and auto-fix this to one month. This is a cost-optimization as Cloudwatch Logs have a very high storage cost. If you need Cloudwatch logs for longer you should set an automated S3 export (cdk-cloudwatch-logs-s3-export is in the works ðŸ˜š).

## Getting started

### TypeScript

#### Installation

##### NPM

```
npm install --save cloudwatch-auto-retention
```

##### yarn

```
yarn add cloudwatch-auto-retention
```

#### Usage

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
import aws_cdk.core as cdk
from cloudwatch_auto_retention import CdkCloudwatchAutoRetention

mock_app = cdk.App()
stack = cdk.Stack(mock_app, "<your-stack-name>")

CdkCloudwatchAutoRetention(stack, "cloudwatch-auto-retention")
```

### Python

#### Installation

```bash
$ pip install cloudwatch-auto-retention
```

#### Usage

```python
import aws_cdk.core as cdk
from cdk_cloudwatch_auto_retention import CdkCloudwatchAutoRetention

app = cdk.App()
stack = cdk.Stack(app, "<your-stack-name>")

CdkCloudwatchAutoRetention(stack, "cloudwatch-auto-retention")
```

## Overview

A Cloudwatch cron rule will trigger a Lambda that will go over all Cloudwatch Log Groups and check if the retention is never-expire. If so, it will change it to one month.
