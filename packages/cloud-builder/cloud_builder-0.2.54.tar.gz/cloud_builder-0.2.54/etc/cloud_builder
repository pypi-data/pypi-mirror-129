#
# Cloud Builder runner count. Specify the number of runners
# that exists in the cluster. This information will be used
# in services which asks for information from the cb-info
# service. Each runner provides an info service. On request
# multiple info services could respond with information about
# a package/image. As the requester doesn't know how many
# answers completes the record, the default behavior is to
# wait for a configurable time of silence on the response
# queue before handing control back to the user and working
# on the results.
#
# This can lead to an unneeded amount of waiting time for
# the user. There is also always the risk that the wait time
# was not long enough to retrieve all answers from the
# cb-info services in the system.
#
# If the information about the number of runners in the
# cluster is provided, this value will be used to count the
# number of answers and if that number equals the number
# of runners it is clear that there can't be more answers
# which leads the reading code to get back to the user
# instead of staying blocked waiting for the timeout.
#
# If the number of runners in the cluster is specified here
# it is also required that all cb-info services are configured
# with:
#
# CB_INFO_RESPONSE_TYPE="--respond-always"
#
# The default value of 0 runners indicates there is no
# knowledge about the amount of runners in the system and that
# leads to the timeout based behavior as explained above
