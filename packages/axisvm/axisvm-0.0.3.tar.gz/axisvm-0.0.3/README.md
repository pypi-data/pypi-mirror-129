**The package is under development. Follow us on social media, where we'll announce the first release!

# **Overview**

The PyAxisVM project offers a high-level interface to AxisVM, making its operations available directly from Python. It builds on top of Microsoft's COM technology and supports all the features of the original AxisVM COM type library, making you able to
  
* build and analyse parametric models

* find solutions with iterative methods

* build specific design extension modules


# **Documentation and Issues**

The ***AxisVM API Reference Guide*** is available in pdf format,  you can download it _[***here***](https://axisvm.eu/axisvm-downloads/#application)_.


Please feel free to post issues and other questions at PyAxisVM Issues. This is the best place to post questions and code.

# **Installation**
This is optional, but we suggest you to create a dedicated virtual enviroment to avoid conflicts with your other projects. Create a folder, open a command shell in that folder and use the following command

```console
>>> python -m venv venv_name
```

Once the enviroment is created, activate it via typing

```console
>>> .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

The AxisVM python package can be installed (either in a virtual enviroment or globally) from PyPI using `pip` on Python >= 3.5:

```console
>>> pip install axisvm
```

# **Dependencies**

You will need a local licenced copy of AxisVM prior and including 13r2. To get a copy of AxisVM, please visit our _[***homepage***](https://axisvm.eu/)_.


# **Getting Started**


## **Register the AxisVM Type Library**

If this is not your first time using the AxisVM through a COM interface on your machine, you should already have a registered type library and you can skip this step. Otherwise, follow the instructions at the beginning of the ***AxisVM API Reference Guide***.


## **Launch AxisVM**

The `axisvm.com.client` submodule implements various tools to handle the client side operations of creating a COM connection. Import the module and start a new application instance with the `start_AxisVM` method.


```python
from axisvm.com.client import start_AxisVM
axapp = start_AxisVM(visible=True, join=True)
```

By providing the keyword argument `join=True`, python is first looking for a running instance of AxisVM, and tries connecting to it. If there is no running instance, a new application is launched. In both cases, the call returns a pointer to an AxisVM aplication. To test the connection, you can query the path of the executable being run by typing `axapp.FullExePath`.

## **Basic Usage**

If the connection is complete, create a new model and get an interface to it.


```python
modelId = axapp.Models.New()
axmodel = axapp.Models.Item[modelId]
```

Every time you create a new AxisVM instance with the `start_AxisVM` command, an attempt is made to import the type library as a python module, or to generate one if necessary. The generated module is then accessible as `axisvm.com.tlb`.
 
The next block of commands adds a line to the scene:


```python
from axisvm.com.tlb import lgtStraightLine, RLineGeomData
n1 = axmodel.Nodes.Add(0, 0, 0)
n2 = axmodel.Nodes.Add(1, 1, 1)
l1 = axmodel.Lines.Add(n1, n2, lgtStraightLine, RLineGeomData())
```

Put AxisVM on top and scale model to fill up the current view:


```python
axapp.BringToFront()
axmodel.FitInView()
```

At the end of your session, release the connection and close the application simply by typing


```python
axapp.UnLoadCOMClients()
axapp.Quit()
```
