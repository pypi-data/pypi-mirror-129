cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

It is loosely based upon the work of kube-lego and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects such as kube-cert-manager.
