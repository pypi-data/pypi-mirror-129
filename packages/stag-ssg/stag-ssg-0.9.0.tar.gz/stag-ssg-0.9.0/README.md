# Stag

Stag is a simple, extensible static site generator, where almost every part
is a plug in. It's almost too easy to extend it with your own
functionalities.

# Features

Out of the box Stag comes with the following features:

- pages can be generated from Markdown with enabled support for footnotes,
  fenced code blocks and some typographic goodies.
- support for Asciidoc (via asciidoctor)
- generic support for file front matters
- Jinja2 templates
- taxonomies (e.g. tags)
- RSS feeds
- generation of nice URLs:
  - _foo/index.md_ → _foo/index.html_
  - _bar.md_ → _bar/index.html_
- extensible with plugins and macros (shortcodes)
