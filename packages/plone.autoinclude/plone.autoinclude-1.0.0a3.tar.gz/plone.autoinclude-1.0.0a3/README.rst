=================
plone.autoinclude
=================

Automatically include zcml of a package when it is loaded in a Plone site.

Features
--------

- It is an alternative to ``z3c.autoinclude``.
- When a package registers an autoinclude entry point, we load its Python code at Zope/Plone startup.
- And we load its zcml.
- Works with Buildout-installed packages.
- Works with pip-installed packages.


Compatibility
-------------

This is made for Python 3.6+.
Since Plone 6.0.0a2 it is included in core Plone.
See `PLIP 3339 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3339>`_.

It also works on Plone 5.2.


For add-on authors
------------------

When you have an existing package that has some zcml, you probably already have something like this in your ``setup.py``::

    entry_points="""
    [z3c.autoinclude.plugin]
    target = plone
    """

or in a dictionary::

    entry_points={
        "z3c.autoinclude.plugin": [
            "target = plone",
        ],
    }

or in ``setup.cfg``::

    [options.entry_points]
    z3c.autoinclude.plugin =
        target=plone

This still works!
You do not need to change anything.

But if you do not care about compatibility with ``z3c.autoinclude``, you could use this new entry point::

    entry_points="""
    [plone.autoinclude.plugin]
    target = plone
    """

It does the same thing, but it only works with ``plone.autoinclude``.

Note: you should *not* add ``plone.autoinclude`` in your ``install_dependencies``.
It is the responsibility of the framework (usually Plone) to do this.


Entry point details
-------------------

This is an entry point with all options specified::

    entry_points="""
    [plone.autoinclude.plugin]
    target = plone
    module = example.alternative
    """

You must specify at least one option, otherwise the entry point does not exist.

``target``
    In which framework should your zcml be loaded?
    For a Plone add-on you would use ``plone``.
    If Zope ever wants to use something similar, it could add configuration to look for packages with ``target="zope"``.
    You can come up with targets yourself, and load them in a policy package, maybe: cms, frontend, companyname, customername, nl/de (language).
    If target is empty, or the option is not there, the zcml will get loaded by all frameworks.

``module``
    Use this when your package name is different from what you import in Python.


Comparison with ``z3c.autoinclude``
-----------------------------------

- ``z3c.autoinclude`` supports ``includeDependencies`` in a zcml file in your package.
  This would look in the ``setup_requires`` of the package to find dependencies.
  For each, it would load the zcml.
  This can take quite long.
  It might not work for packages installed by ``pip``, but this is not confirmed.
  In the Plone community this is discouraged, and Plone already disables this in the tests.
  ``plone.autoinclude`` does not support this.
  You should load the zcml of the dependencies explicitly in the ``configure.zcml`` of your package.
- ``z3c.autoinclude`` tries hard to find packages in non-standard places, installed in weird or old ways,
  or with a module name that differs from the package name, with code especially suited for eggs that buildout installs.
  ``plone.autoinclude`` simply uses ``importlib.import_module`` on the module name.
  If there is a mismatch between package name and module name, you can set ``module = modulename`` in your entry point.
- ``z3c.autoinclude`` does not support empty targets.
  The target of the entry point must match the target that is being loaded.
  ``plone.autoinclude`` *does* support empty targets: they will always get loaded.
  This is not good or bad, it is just a different choice.
- ``z3c.autoinclude`` supports disabling loading the plugins, via either an environment variable or an api call.
  ``plone.autoinclude`` does not.
  But ``Products.CMFPlone`` currently loads the ``z3c.autoinclude`` plugins unless a zcml condition is true: ``not-have disable-autoinclude``.
  When ``Products.CMFPlone`` switches to ``plone.autoinclude``, it can use this same condition.

In general, ``plone.autoinclude`` is a bit more modern, as it only started in 2020, and only supports Python 3.


Usage in Plone 5.2
------------------

Since Plone 6.0.0a2 this is included in core, so nothing needs to be done there.
If you want to use it in Plone 5.2, this is possible.
First add it to your buildout::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs +=
        plone.autoinclude
    zcml +=
        plone.autoinclude.ploneinclude-meta
        plone.autoinclude.ploneinclude
        plone.autoinclude.ploneinclude-overrides

This will include three zcml files from the ``ploneinclude`` directory.
It will do this:

- Disable the original z3c.autoinclude.
- Load CMFPlone meta.zcml, so the order in which zcml is loaded stays mostly the same.
- Load plone.autoinclude meta.zcml.
- Automatically include the meta.zcml of all plone plugins.
- Load CMFPlone configure.zcml.
- Automatically include the configure.zcml of all plone plugins.
- Load CMFPlone overrides.zcml.
- Automatically include the overrides.zcml of all plone plugins.


For other frameworks
--------------------

You can take the above section as example, and take care of the following

- Include the ``plone.autoinclude`` package in ``install_requires``.
- In your meta.zcml load the meta.zcml of plone.autoinclude.
- In your meta.zcml load the meta.zcml of your plugins:
  ``<autoIncludePlugins target="your-framework" file="meta.zcml" />``
- In your configure.zcml load the configure.zcml of your plugins:
  ``<autoIncludePlugins target="your-framework" file="configure.zcml" />``
- In your overrides.zcml load the meta.zcml of your plugins in override mode:
  ``<autoIncludePluginsOverrides target="your-framework" file="meta.zcml" />``


Installation with pip
---------------------

Let's leave buildout completely out of the picture and only use pip, in this case with plone 5.2.5.
We use the legacy resolver from pip, to avoid some possible problems that have nothing to do with autoinclude::

    # Create virtual environment in the current directory:
    python3.8 -mvenv .
    # Install Plone and Paste:
    bin/pip install -c https://dist.plone.org/release/5.2.5/constraints.txt Products.CMFPlone Paste --use-deprecated legacy-resolver
    # Install plone.autoinclude from the current git checkout:
    bin/pip install -e .
    # or 'bin/pip install plone.autoinclude' to get the latest from PyPI.
    # Create the Zope WSGI instance:
    bin/mkwsgiinstance -d . -u admin:admin
    # Copy our zcml that disables z3c.autoinclude and enables our own.
    cp -a package-includes etc/
    # Start Zope:
    bin/runwsgi -v etc/zope.ini
