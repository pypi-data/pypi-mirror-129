"""
in case you want to manipulate the value in all the rasters of one of the inputs
for example evapotranspiration values in rasters downloaded from ECMWF are -ve
and to change it to +ve in all rasters or if you want to operate any kind of function
in all input rasters that are in the same folder FolderCalculator can do this task

"How can evaporation have both positive and negative values?
Evaporation is normally negative due to the convention for fluxes.
The meteorological convention for all vertical fluxes is that downwards is positive.
Positive evaporation represents condensation'.
