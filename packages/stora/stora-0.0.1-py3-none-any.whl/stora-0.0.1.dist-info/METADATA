# Stora

**Stora** is a simple, reactive local storage library.

```python
>>> from stora import stora
>>> apple = {"name": "Apple", "price": "10", "size": "small"}
>>> s = stora(apple)
>>> s.state
'{"name": "Apple", "price": "10", "size": "small"}'
>>> s.file
'/home/user/project/state.json'
>>> s.state["size"] = "middle"
>>> s.state
'{"name": "Apple", "price": "10", "size": "middle"}'
```
