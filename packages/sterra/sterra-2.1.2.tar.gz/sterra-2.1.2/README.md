# üõ† Usage:
### Check [Examples](https://github.com/novitae/sterraxcyl/blob/main/README.md#-examples) if you are lost
## üßÆ Arguments:
```python
sterra -t {followers,following,both,mutuals} (-u U | -id ID) (-lcrd U P | -ssid S)
       [--all-infos] [--do-not-export] [-e] [-f {excel,csv}] [-h] [--no-limit] [--no-btc]
       [-p P] [-a] [--pctg PCTG] [--size SIZE] [--url] [--descending]
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required:
```python
-t {followers,following,both,mutuals}, --target {followers,following,both,mutuals}
                      what do you want to export ("followers", "following", "both" or "mutuals")
                      #mutuals are the accounts following and followed by the target
-u U, --username U    the instagram username of the aimed account
-id ID                the instagram id of the aimed account
```
### üè† Login:
```python
-lcrd U P, --login-credentials U P
                      login by credentials: USERNAME PASSWORD (be sure to keep a space between them)
-ssid S, --login-session-id S
                      login by SessionID
```
### üìä Probabilities:
```python
-a, --activate-data-analysis
                      activates a data analysis that prints, for each accounts in the target lists, the probabilities of being an account from the close circle of the target
--pctg PCTG           percentage under wich we won't print results (between 0 and 98)
--size SIZE           size of the most probable username list (will be by default the size of the followers/mutuals/following list filled in)
--url                 instead of printing username, printing the url to the account
--descending          instead of printing by highest probability, printing by lowest probability
```
### ‚ùáÔ∏è Optional:
```python
--all-infos           writes down the account extra informations that the program originaly ignores
--do-not-export       do not export to file
-e, --express         sends ultra fast requests to get the table faster (deactivated if more than 109 total usernames to avoid blocking)
-f {excel,csv}, --format {excel,csv}
                      format of the export, by default "excel"
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--no-limit            disable the limitation for lists over 1000 follow(ers|ing); all errors you could get by doing this will not recieve help if you submit it at the issue page of sterraxcyl
--no-btc              hides the invitation to donations printed at the end
-p P, --path P        directory path where export the files (by default in your module path)
```
## üí° Examples
#### ‚úÖ `sterra` or `sterraxcyl` can be both used to invoke the program.  
‚û°Ô∏è Print the __help__:
```
sterra -h
```
‚¨áÔ∏è Export to __excel__, in the /export directory of the module, the __accounts kyliejenner follows__:  
```
sterra -u kyliejenner -t following -lcrd USERNAME PASSWORD
```
‚¨áÔ∏è Same than before, but in __express mode__, and with a lot __more details__ exported (see further will --all-infos) in a __csv__ instea of excel:
```
sterra -u kyliejenner -t following -sssid SESSIONID -e -f csv --all-infos
```
‚¨áÔ∏è __No exports__, but will print the __10 highest probabilities__ for each account following chrstianpedroza that he follows back of __being a personnal accounts__:
```
sterra -u chrstianpedroza -t mutuals -sssid -a --size 10 --do-not-export
```
‚¨áÔ∏è __Export at desktop/OSINT/ followers and following__ of chrstianpedroza, and also print the __15 lowest probabilites of being personnal accounts__ in each lists.
```
sterra -u chrstianpedroza -t both -sssid -a -p desktop/OSINT/ --descending --size 15
```
# üìå Notes
- [Here](https://skylens.io/blog/how-to-find-your-instagram-session-id) is a tutorial on how you can find your "__sessionid__".
- If you want to extract lists __without express mode__, __it will take a long time__. I advise to do something else while the program does the job.
- Even if instagram never blocked an account used by sterra (from all the test i made, and for the people who tested for me), __it is better if you use an account made specially for the occasion__. __I do not recommend using your personnal account__ !
- The account you will use must have __2FA disabled__.
- If the target __account is private__, __you must be following it__ to extract data of it.
- If instagram blocks you, i recommend __using another account__.
- This program can be very powerful against most of instagram users, including big accounts: i tried it once one real account (with 250k followers), and it brought me very far. __I'm not responsible of its misuse, but don't do shit with it__.
- The program __doesn't work on GitPod__.

This program took me a lot of time; if you appreciate it, feel free to reward my work here:  
`BTC bc1qjdw2hsspdlw7j9j9qn24gnujnk5thdmt6h2kjh`  
If you believe as me that this program have a big potential, and want to work on it with me, my dms are open on twitter. 
  
I will soon have no more time for coding during a certain period. Feel free to work on my program if you want to make it better.  
If you want to help this project, here is a "to do" list:
- Exportation on tables of the probabilities printed at the end with `-a` arg.
- Adding probabilities of interests (actually there's just probabilities of being a personnal accounts)
- Making a list of rotating userangents to be less visible by instagram
- Making a timeout arg to avoid blocking (in class retrieve_list_username_infos)
- Tor ?
