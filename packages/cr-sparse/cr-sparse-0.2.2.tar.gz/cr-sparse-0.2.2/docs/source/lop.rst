Linear Operators
=======================

We provide a collection of linear operators with efficient JAX based implementations 
that are
relevant in standard signal/image processing problems.
We also provide a bunch of utilities to combine and convert
linear operators.

This module is inspired by ``pylops`` although the implementation approach 
is different.

A linear operator :math:`T : X \to Y` connects a model space :math:`X` 
to a data space :math:`Y`.

A linear operator satisfies following laws:

.. math::

    T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y)


.. math::

    T (\alpha x) = \alpha T(x)


Thus, for a general linear combination:

.. math::

    T (\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha T (x) + \beta T (y)

We are concerned with linear operators :math:`T : \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m`
where :math:`\mathbb{F}` is either the field of real numbers or 
complex numbers. 
:math:`X = \mathbb{F}^n` is the model space and 
:math:`Y = \mathbb{F}^m` is the data space.

Such a linear operator can be represented by a two dimensional matrix :math:`A`.

The forward operation is given by:

.. math::

    y = A x.

The corresponding adjoint operation is given by:

.. math::

    \hat{x} = A^H y

We represent a linear operator by a pair of functions ``times`` and ``trans``. 
The ``times`` function implements the forward operation while the ``trans``
function implements the adjoint operation.

An inverse problem consists of computing :math:`x` given :math:`y` and :math:`A`.

..  rubric:: 1D, 2D, ND operators

* A 1D operator takes a 1D array as input and returns a 1D array as output.
  E.g. identity, pad, etc.
* A 2D operator takes a 2D array as input and returns a 2D array as output. 
  E.g. conv2D, dwt2D, etc.
* An ND operator takes an ND array as input and returns an ND array as output.

The vectors may be stored using multi-dimensional arrays in memory. 
E.g., images are usually stored in 2-3 dimensional arrays.
The operators themselves may work directly on multi-dimensions arrays. 
E.g. a 2D convolution operator can be applied directly
to an image to result in another image. 

In other words, the vectors from the model space as well as data space 
may be stored in memory using 1D,2D,...,ND array.  They should still
be treated as vectors for the purposes of this module.

This is a departure from pylops convention where input to a 
linear operator must be flattened into a 1D array and output 
needs to be reshaped again.
In this library, the input and output to a 2D linear operator 
would be a 2D array.

.. rubric:: axis parameter in a 1D linear operator

* A 1D linear operator may get an ND array as input.
* In this case, the axis parameter to the operator specifies the
  axis along which the linear operator is to be applied.
* The input ND array will be broken into slices of 1D arrays along the
  axis and the linear operator will be applied separately to each slice.
* Then the slices will be combined to generate the output ND array.
* E.g. if the input is a matrix then:
  
  * axis=0 means apply the linear operator over each column (along axis=0)
  * axis=1 means apply the linear operator over each row  (along axis=1)

This is based on the convention followed by ``numpy.apply_along_axis``.
