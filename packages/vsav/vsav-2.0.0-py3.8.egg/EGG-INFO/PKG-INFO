Description: # Save, Restore, Diff versions of files
        
        Easily save and restore files while preserving the access
        and modification times of the original file.
        
        ## Installation
        
            python3 setup.py install
        
        ## Version save
        
            vsav file ...
            
        Saves each *file* by making a copy.
        The saved filename is `file.v.nnn`
        where `nnn` is the highest version number found plus one.
        
        Version numbers consist of 3 decimal digits with leading zeros if
        necessary.  The initial version number is `000`.
        
        The saved file retains the access and modification times of the 
        original file.
        
        Use `vres` to restore saved files.
        
        ## Version restore
        
            vres file ...
            
        Restores each *file* from the indicated version.
        If *file* has the form `dest.v.nnn`
        where `nnn` is a version number,
        then the file is restored from this version.
        Otherwise, the file is restored from its highest version.
        
        Version numbers consist of 3 decimal digits with leading zeros if
        necessary.
        
        The source file was presumably created using `vsav`.
        The destination file retains the access and modification times
        of the source file.
        
        ## Version Diff
        
            vdif file [diff-OPTION] ...
        
        Compares a previous version to the current version of the file
        using diff.
        Arguments after `file` are passed to diff.
        
        If `file` has the form `dest.v.nnn` where `nnn` is a version number,
        then this version is compared to the current version:
        
            diff [diff OPTION] ... dest.v.nnn dest
        
        otherwise the highest version is compared to the current version:
        
            diff [diff OPTION] ... file.v.nnn file
        
        where `nnn` is the highest version number.
