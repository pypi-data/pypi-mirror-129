    """
    Generates 2D array of size ``(n, m)`` where ``m`` is the dimension of the
    space, and ``n`` is the number of generated points inside a unit hypercube.
    The number ``n`` is determined as follow:

    * If ``grid`` is ``False``, then ``n`` is ``num_points``.
    * If ``grid`` is ``True``, the ``num_points`` is the number of points
      along each axes of a grid of points. Thus, ``n`` is
      ``num_points**dimension``.

    :param num_points: Number of points of the generated data.
        * If ``grid`` is ``False``, the ``num_points`` is the number of random
          points to be generated in the unit hypecube.
        * If ``grid`` is ``True``, the ``num_points`` is the number of points
          along each axes of a grid of points. Thus, the total number of points
          will be ``num_points**dimension``.

    :param dimension: The dimension of hypercube to which generated points
        inside it.

        a grid of points, or randomly generated.
