logdag

Overview
========

This package generates causal DAGs among time-series events in syslog data.
This package works on python3.
The input log data is loaded with AMULOG (https://github.com/cpflat/amulog).
The output DAG is recorded in the format of NetworkX DiGraph.

This project was partially forked from repository LogCausalAnaysis.
(https://github.com/cpflat/LogCausalAnalysis)


Usage
======

All features are available from command line. First you should try following help command :code:`python -m logdag -h`.

short usage:

1. Generate amulog database (and its config) as the input log time-series source
2. Prepare logdag config file by referring :code:`logdag/data/config.conf.default`
3. Generate time-series db by :code:`logdag.source` features
4. Generate DAGs by subcommand :code:`makedag`
5. See results by commands such as :code:`show-edge-list`
