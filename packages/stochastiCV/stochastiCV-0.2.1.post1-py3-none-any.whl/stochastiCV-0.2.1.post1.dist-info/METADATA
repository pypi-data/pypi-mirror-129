StochastiCV
==============================

A method of cross-validation based on scikit-learn that splits data one or more times (using random or assigned seed values) and then repeats the model multiple times using different seeds. Current implementations include subsampling (simple train/test splits based on a ratio) and *k*-folds (split data into *k* splits, combining all but one for the train split and the left over one for the test split, repeated *k* times).

This function outputs metrics in a pandas DataFrame, including (for classification) sensitivity (aka *recall*), specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) (aka *precision*), negative predictive value (NPV), f1_score, and overall accuracy, and (for regression) R2, adjusted R2, mean average error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error, for each repeat of the model. Different model variations (e.g., hyperparmeter modification, feature sets, model architectures) can be statistically differentiated using ANOVAs or t-tests, facilitated by the reduced variance caused by large numbers of stochastic model repeats as compared to repeated shuffling of data.

If model stochasticity is desired (running model multiple times with varying outputs), only ensemble models and neural networks (e.g., multilayer perceptron) are supported. This is due to the use of stochasticity (randomness) within these types of models, to either assign initial weights (neural networks), in bootstrapping, or when searching for the best split at each node (ensemble models).

## Installation

To install the current release:
```
$ pip install stochastiCV
```

## API

A stochastiCV machine based on either subsampling or *k*-folds can be called, with required parameters including the scikit-learn model, number of times splits are repeated, and number of times models are repeated. When classifiers are used, the number of classes is also required to be specified (if more than 2). In a *k*-folds  machine, the number of folds are also specified.
```
from stochastiCV import StochasticSubsamplingCV, StochasticKFoldsCV, StochasticLeavePOutCV, StochasticMachine
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Subsampling
scv = StochasticSubsamplingCV(rf, split_repeats=5, model_repeats=5, num_classes=3, test_ratio=0.25)

# K Folds
scv = StochasticKFoldsCV(rf, folds=3, split_repeats=5, model_repeats=5, num_classes=3)

# No splitting, model repeats only
scv = StochasticMachine(rf, model_repeats=5)
```
The API will automatically detect whether a given model is a regressor or classifier, however it will only do so for scikit-learn models. If you wish to pass another type of model into the machine, you can specify whether the model is a regressor or classifier by specifying ```model_type='clf'``` for a classifier or ```model_type='reg'``` for a regressor.


The machine is then ran by calling the ```.fit_predict()``` function. 
```
out = scv.fit_repeat(X, y)
```
The function will split the inputted data (X for features, y for
 classes) into *j* number of splits, multiplied by *k* folds if applicable. The model is also repeated *h* times, as specified. The data is stratified by default, but this can be disabled by setting ```stratify=False```. 

If you choose for data shuffling to be disabled, and you wish to specify a train and test set and only enable repeats due to model stochasticity, you may specify a test set as follows:
```
out = scv.fit_repeat(X_train, y_train, X_test=X_test, y_test=y_test)
```
This will disable the ```split_repeats``` parameter, and only run the model the amount of times specified in the ```model_repeats``` and (in *k*-folds) the ```folds``` parameters.

### Output
At present, the output is a pandas dataframe containing, for classification: sensitivities, specificities, PPVs, NPVs, f1_scores, and 
accuracy metrics for both each individual class and averaged for all classes, and for regression: r2, adjusted r2, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error, with one row per repeat of the model. For classifier models, confusion matrices for each repeat can be called by setting ```verbose=2```.

### Model and Split seeds
Split and model repetitions are performed by specifying different random seeds, and thus are deterministic (every run of a model will produce identical results, given parameters are kept the same). If you wish to produce different results with subsequent runs, or if you wish greater control, you can specify the exact seeds that are used for either/both split and model repeats by passing a list of integers instead of a single integer. For example, to specify different split and model repeat seeds:
```
scv = StochasticSubsamplingCV(rf, split_repeats=[10,20,30,40,50], model_repeats=[5,15,25,35,45])
```
This will run the model ```5 x 5 = 25``` times, and will produce different results than simply passing an integer of 5 for each.

### Averaging (classification only)
Metrics are calculated for each individual class as well as the average of all classes. Averaging for metrics is identical to that used in scikit-learn's recall and precision functions: 'macro' finds the unweighted mean, 'micro' calculates global means, and 'weighted' calculates means for each class weighted by the number of instances of each class compared to the number of instances of all classes.

### Over- and under-sampling of splits (classification only)
The option is provided for the train and/or test splits to be over- or under-sampled, using Synthetic Majority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) for oversampling and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) for undersampling, as implemented by *imbalanced-learn*. This is implemented directly into the machine to mitigate leakage that would be present if the the data was split after oversampling was performed.

Either ```imbalanced_train``` or ```imbalanced_test``` can be set to 'over' (oversampling), 'under' (for undersampling), or 'overunder' to first oversample and then undersample, a technique that leads to more even class proportions and less overfitting by first oversampling the minority class by a small amount (e.g. 10%) and then undersampling the majority class by a larger amount (e.g. 30%), resulting in less artificially created datapoints yet more even class sizes. If categorical features are used, they should be specified by setting ```categorical_features``` to a list of feature labels. *Imbalanced-learn*'s categorical SMOTE function (SMOTENC) will then be used.

The strategies for SMOTE and ENN are used to specify the degree of over- or under-sampling performed. See ```imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE``` documentation for ```sampling_strategy```, as this is passed to our parameter ```over_strategy```. For the parameter ```under_strategy```, see ```imblearn.under_sampling.EditedNearestNeighbours```.  

### Initial splits
Occasionally, when data is limited, optimization or other processing must be performed on a subset of the data. If this data is added to the testing set, leakage can occur that would impact the ability to utilize output metrics (e.g., accuracy) in comparison to models where leakage did not occur. The option for an "initial split" was therefore implemented that enables the ```sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split``` function to be performed prior to any other data splitting, with this split added back in to the training set only to ensure that no data is wasted.

For example, if you have 100 points of data, but you wish to use 25% to initially identify the model's optimal hyperparameters, you could perform a ```sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split``` function with the parameters ```train_ratio=0.25``` and ```random_seed=42``` outside of the stochastiCV machine. Once ideal hyperparamters are identified and the model is initialized with them, the stochastiCV model ```StochasticSubsamplingCV``` or ```StochasticKFoldsCV``` could be called with the parameters ```initial_split_ratio=0.25``` and ```initial_split_seed=42```. Thus, the same data points would be initially removed (before splitting occurs) and then added back into every train set, ensuring that data used in hyperparameter optimization is not wasted but also never appears in the test set.

### Thresholding (classification only)
In some situations, it is beneficial to manually set the threshold for determining a class based on its predicted probabilities. We have enabled the ability to do so by assigning the ```threshold``` parameter within the ```.fit_predict()``` function for either each individual class  (pass a list of floats) or overall (pass a single float, binary only). This enables weaker classifier to be given more weight, allowing accuracy metrics to be better dialed in to a more favorable result. 

For example, in some medical applications, specificity (negative class recall) is more useful than sensitivity (positive class recall) -- assigning the threshold to be a lower number may result in higher specificities at the expense of lower sensitivities.

## To Do:
- Implement LeavePOutCV 
	- Classification must create an aggregate confusion matrix for scoring
	- Regression must accurately average errors, and disable output of r2 scores
- Enable raw output for more in-depth analysis
	- Aggregate confusion matrix: option for either sum total of all repeats, or averaged 
	- Raw y_test / y_pred outputs per run, for plotting ROC/PR curves
- Add augmentation for regression analyses
- Addition of area under ROC and Precision-Recall curves for classifiers
- Enabling randomization of repeats if integer is passed to ```split_repeats``` or ```model_repeats```
- Keras and PyTorch implementations
