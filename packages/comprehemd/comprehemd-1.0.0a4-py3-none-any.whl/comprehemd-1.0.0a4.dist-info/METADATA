# 🤔 CompreheMD

**CompreheMD** is a Python package for parsing Markdown documents.

<edition value="toc" />


## Installation

CompreheMD requires Python 3.8 or later.

Install CompreheMD via pip:

```bash
pip install comprehemd
```

## MarkdownParser class

### Parsing a stream

_The Markdown document parsed in this example is [example.md](https://cariad.github.io/comprehemd/example.md)._

To read an entire text stream, call `.read(reader: IO[str])`. The method yields [blocks](#blocks-classes) until the stream ends.

```python
from comprehemd import MarkdownParser

with open("docs/example.md", "r") as fp:
    for block in MarkdownParser().read(fp):
        print(block)
```

<!--edition-exec as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
HeadingBlock (1): An Example Document
EmptyBlock
HeadingBlock (2): Introduction
EmptyBlock
Block: This is just a short example document.
EmptyBlock
HeadingBlock (2): Block examples
EmptyBlock
Block: Here's some backtick-fenced code:
EmptyBlock
CodeBlock (python): print("Hello, world!")
EmptyBlock
Block: Here's some tilde-fenced code:
EmptyBlock
CodeBlock (python): print("Hello, galaxy!")
EmptyBlock
Block: Here's some indented code:
EmptyBlock
CodeBlock (<None>): print("Hello, multiverse!")
EmptyBlock
Block: That's your lot!
```

<!--edition-exec range=end-->

### Parsing chunks

The parser can be fed ad-hoc chunks of Markdown. The `.feed(chunk: str)` method yields all the [blocks](#blocks-classes) that the chunk completed.

After feeding the final chunk, you must call `.close()` to flush and yield any buffered blocks.

```python
from comprehemd import CodeBlock, HeadingBlock, MarkdownParser

def tease(chunk: str) -> None:
    escaped = chunk.replace("\n", "\\n")
    for block in parser.feed(chunk):
        print(f'After "{escaped}", the parser yielded:')
        print(block)
        print()
    else:
        print(f'After "{escaped}", the parser did not yield.')
        print()


parser = MarkdownParser()

tease("# Feeding exam")
tease("ple\n\nThis de")
tease("monstrates chu")
tease("nked feeding.")

for block in parser.close():
    print("After closing, the parser yielded:")
    print(block)
    print()

```

<!--edition-exec as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
After "# Feeding exam", the parser did not yield.

After "ple\n\nThis de", the parser yielded:
HeadingBlock (1): Feeding example

After "ple\n\nThis de", the parser yielded:
EmptyBlock

After "ple\n\nThis de", the parser did not yield.

After "monstrates chu", the parser did not yield.

After "nked feeding.", the parser did not yield.

After closing, the parser yielded:
Block: This demonstrates chunked feeding.
```

<!--edition-exec range=end-->

## Blocks classes

### Block

The `Block` class is the base of all blocks.

- `source` returns the original Markdown source for the block.
- `text` returns the meaningful text representation of the block.

### CodeBlock

The `CodeBlock` class represents a code block.

- `language` returns the language hint if one was specified.
- The block can be rendered back to Markdown by calling `render(writer: IO[str], fence: Fence)`.

### EmptyBlock

`EmptyBlock` represents an empty line.

### HeadingBlock

The `HeadingBlock` class represents a heading.

- `level` returns the heading's level (i.e. 1 for the top-most heading, down to 6 for the lowest).
