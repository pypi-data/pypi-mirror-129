# extremals

The python module extremals consists in a toolset to inspect pandas dataframes looking for ”extremal” rows, i.e. rows ”numerically different” from others.
This may help filtering a dataframe from anomalous numerical data or, on the
contrary, highlight exceptional rows from common ones.
