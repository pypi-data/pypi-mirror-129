Description: # What is Ivy?
        
        Ivy is a templated deep learning framework which maximizes the portability
              of deep learning codebases. Ivy wraps the functional APIs of existing frameworks. Framework-agnostic functions,
              libraries and layers can then be written using Ivy, with simultaneous support for all frameworks.
              Ivy currently supports Jax, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and Numpy. Check out the [docs](https://ivy-dl.org/ivy) for more info!
