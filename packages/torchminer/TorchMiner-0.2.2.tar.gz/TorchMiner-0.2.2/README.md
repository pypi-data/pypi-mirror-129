# Description
TorchMiner is designed to automatic process the training ,evaluating and testing process for PyTorch DeepLearning,with a simple API.

You can access all Functions of MineTorch simply use `Miner`.

## Project ToDo

 [] Make Console Output a plugin 
 
 [] Abstract Plugin Manager

 [] Move ***Drawer*** Operations Outside of Miner as a Plugin
 
 [] Add Plugin Able And Disable Stat
 
 [] Move Miner Options to yaml File, Add Config Class
 
 Now Plugins only supports output functions, they can't modify or change the data of the Miner class.Any Ideas? I am glad to know.
 
 [] Write about my design concept
