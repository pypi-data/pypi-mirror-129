**Pipeline abstractions for deep learning**.

Full documentation here: https://lf1-io.github.io/padl/

**PADL**:

- is a pipeline builder for **PyTorch**. 
- may be used with all of the great **PyTorch** functionality you're used to for writing layers.
- allows users to build pre-processing, forward passes, loss functions **and** post-processing into the pipeline
- models may have arbitrary topologies and make use of arbitrary packages from the python ecosystem
- allows for converting standard functions to **PADL** components using a single keyword `transform`.

**PADL** was developed at [LF1](https://lf1.io/) an AI innovation lab based in Berlin, Germany.

## Getting Started

```
pip install padl
```

**Your first PADL program**

```python
from padl import transform, batch, unbatch
import torch
from torch import nn
nn = transform(nn)

@transform
def prepare(x):
    return torch.tensor(x)

@transform
def post(x):
  	return x.topk(1)[1].item()

my_pipeline = prepare >> batch >> nn.Linear(10, 20) >> unbatch >> post
```
