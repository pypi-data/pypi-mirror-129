**llspy-slm** is a simple python app for generating binary masks to drive
the spatial light modulator (SLM) on Lattice Light Sheet microscopes.
It can generate both *square lattices* and *hex lattices*, and includes
the ability to automatically set various parameters such as wavelength
dependent beam-spacing (fully manually control is also available).
Additionally, there is a batch square lattice feature that can be used
to generate a large number of parameter permutations easily.

See complete usage notes in the `documentation <http://llspy-slm.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Requirements
============

* Compatible with Windows (tested on 7/10), Mac or Linux (tested on
  Ubuntu 16.04)
* Python 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, or 2.7

Installation
============

#. Install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_
#. Launch a ``terminal`` window (OS X, Linux), or ``Anaconda Prompt`` (Windows)
#. Install llspy-slm (note: as of version 0.2.0, you now must install
   either pyside2 or pyqt explicitly):

    .. code:: bash

        > conda create -n slmenv
        > conda activate slmenv
        > conda install -c talley -c conda-forge llspy-slm pyqt

    The ``create -n slmenv`` line creates a virtual environment.
    This is optional, but recommended as it easier to uninstall cleanly
    and prevents conflicts with any other python environments.
    If installing into a virtual environment, you must source the
    environment before proceeding, and each time before using llspy-slm.

#. The gui can be launched with ``slmgen``.  You can create a bash script
   or batch file to autoload the environment and launch the program if desired.

    .. code:: bash

        # Launch Anaconda Prompt and type...

        > conda activate slmenv

        # launch the gui
        > slmgen


See complete usage notes in the `documentation <http://llspy-slm.readthedocs.io/>`_.

LLSpy Release History
#####################

`0.1.1`_
========

**Changed:**

* renamed main funcs in slm.py
* increased crop precision in gui to 0.001

**Fixed:**

* on windows, the batch write function creates unpredictable output files due to weird windows multi-threading.  For now, restricting batch write to a single thread on windows... will make things slower than Mac or Linux.
* Fix bug that that prevented writing Hex patterns to file
* Fix bug when batch shift/tilt ranges have a single number <= 0

`0.1.0`_
========

First release as independent package (independent from main LLSpy package)

**Added:**

* Hex pattern generator added to SLM Pattern Generator
* Ronchi-ruling pattern generator added to SLMgen
* Batch SLM pattern generation
* Docs for SLM generator GUI
* Option to dither SLM preview in SLM Pattern Generator
* User-adjustable LUTs for SLM pattern previews

**Changed:**

* SLM pattern generator moved into seperate package: *slmgen*
* Better multi-threading when batch-writing SLM patterns

**Fixed:**

* SLM pattern generator now writes 1-bit file usable on SLM, instead of 8-bit png (thank you for reporting Felix!)
