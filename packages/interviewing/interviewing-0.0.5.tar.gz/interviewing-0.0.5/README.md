# Interviewing

Interviewing is a sassy package for shaming unimaginative interviewers.

Have you ever walked in to an interview and been asked to calculate the optimal time to buy and sell a stock?

Well, gone are the days of remembering interview-only algorithms. 
Instead, simply import the question from `interviewing`'s `questions` module and use our code instead.

```python
from interviewing.questions import buy_and_sell_a_stock_once
```

No more fizzbuzz! No more is_palindrome! No more lame interview questions!
