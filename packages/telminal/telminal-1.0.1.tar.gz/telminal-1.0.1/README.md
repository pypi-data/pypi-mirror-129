## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need telegram developer API and a bot token\
[API ID API hash](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)\
[Bot token](https://t.me/botfather)\
Very fast and easy you can have those, just follow this two official links.
### Installation

    pip install telminal
### Setup
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30555691/140306836-98773769-41d5-4d19-b113-f610766f85bf.mp4

Run `telminal` command after installation finished. Telminal needs those Telegram tokens for first run.\
Also you can create a `config.json` file inside the package directory in this format:
<pre>
{
    "api_id": 1234,
    "api_hash": "abcs",
    "token": "efgh",
    "admins": [8888, 9999]
}
</pre>
‚ö†Ô∏è First admin can manage other admins, so order of admins list matter.\
In this sample config 8888 must be your Telegram user ID.


## Interactive Mode

You can activate this mode for last running process by sending `/interactive_mode` or by clicking on `Interactive mode` button of each process.\
In interactive mode you are talking to the process and each message means an input for that process.\
Also a two characters message starts with `^` has own meaning and behave like a control command so `^c` means `CTRL + C`.\
To return to normal mode and creating a new process just use `/normal_mode` or `Exit interactive mode` button.

## Optional image output

Image creation for process result is optimized and will be okay on a server with minimum resources.\
However, creating an image on the server is an expensive process. so if you want to run multiple commands at once or have a process that does not require image output, I strongly recommend using the text version by sending `\image_off` command.

## Download file from server
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30555691/140307742-4ee6358a-4f9c-4289-aae4-55491d8e524d.mp4

You can save any file (up to 2GB) of your server on telegram.\
There are two ways to do this :
- Inline query
- !get command

Inline query just works for current directory and runs a `ls -la | grep <your_query>` in background.\
With `!get` command you can specify path of a file manually.\
Also you have a nice progress bar when you are downloading or uploading a heavy file.üòé

## Upload file to server
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30555691/140307784-34f1246e-514d-41a0-b60f-1edc58fef1ab.mp4

Upload a file on your server just by sending to Telminal chat.\
that file can be in telegram or on your hard disk.

## Multi admin in group
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30555691/140308347-a5bb32ce-658b-4d41-8984-2b52e29996f5.mp4

Fortunately, all features can be used in a group too. by default, Telminal only responds to your commands.\
`!trust` and `!untrust` are two commands that manage a user permission.\
just reply to one of the user's messages with these commands.

## Tasks
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30555691/140308392-3cc1c786-6e55-488f-ae09-7b847441dc03.mp4

At this moment there is only one type of task.\
A `watcher` task downloads a file periodically. write your first watcher in the following format:

```!watch <number><s,m,h> <file_path>```

**Some real examples :**

1Ô∏è‚É£ get `telminal.log` every 50 seconds
üëâ <b>!watch 50s telminal.log</b>

2Ô∏è‚É£ get `temp.png` every 5 minutes
üëâ <b>!watch 5m home/temp.png</b>

3Ô∏è‚É£ get `sql.dump` every 24 hours
üëâ <b>!watch 24h /backups/sql.dump</b>    

---

Finally set Telminal commands in [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) using this text.
<pre>
image_off - Just text output
image_on - Text and image output
tasks - List of active tasks
interacive_mode - Interact with last process
normal_mode - Process creation mode
</pre>
