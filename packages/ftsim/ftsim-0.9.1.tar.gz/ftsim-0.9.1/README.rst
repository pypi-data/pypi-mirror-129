FTSim - Warehouse Transport Simulation
======================================

This Python Package simulates and visualizes the transport of loadunits 
in a simple warehouse environment. 

Different layouts and optionaly orders are stored in a database
and can be used, changed, added by the user.

The loadunits can be transported in and between areas, like
conveyor belts, workstations for picking and storage areas.
This can be done manually, automatically or driven by orders.

The basic idea of this project was dealing with the question
if the time required for a batch of orders is predictable.

Work in progress
================

The  Softwareproject `FtSim` is still **at work**, and the documentation is not finished.
Since december 21 it is on  `pypi.org`.

If You have any questions, suggestions, corrections,
please feel free to contact me at g.w.sachs@gmx.de, - I would be very pleased.

Audiance
========

The project can be used just for playing, or to train sql skills.
For developers the combination of tkinter, sqlite and threading
might be of interest. The main iussue was about the question if the time required for a batch of orders
is predictable.

Installation
============
The project does not need any extra packages, its all in
the standard library. 
Make sure you are using python3:

.. code-block:: text
