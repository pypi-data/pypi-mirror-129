txts = ["""No Rohny J, it doesn't CLEARLY indicate it can't find the drives.  The new error is that the program won't even open. And on the uninstall, for the 2nd time, it failed. I'm giving up on your support.  It's been nothing but more wasted time for me. I now have to get my 2nd new warranty replacement drive cloned and installed into my laptop and have the 2nd failed warranty ssd returned to you before you bill me more. I've already paid too much to have replacement drives sent to me. At this point, I could have simply bought a new drive, probably for less than WD has been charging for warranty replacement. It's a real shame customer service has fallen as much as it has.  Customer service is all we have sometimes, and WD used to have such high standards. I've gotten very tired of dealing with WD. In my 30 year IT career, I've never bought another product but WD. Now it's causing me more headache than necessary.  Not a happy customer. ~Betsy""", """I hear a noise whne it trys to run. It shows on my PC but that it has 0 room. I've tried checking the wires to it and they are fine. The system will not allow me to do anything with the drive. Thankfully I only had a couple of things on it. I have tried my other drives and then are fine. It was working until the vibration noise started. Now this drive doesn't work.
