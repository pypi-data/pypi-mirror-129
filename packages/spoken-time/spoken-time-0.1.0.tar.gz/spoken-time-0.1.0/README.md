# spoken_time: Format dates and times for TTS

This is a tiny library to format date and time strings so they sound reasonable when spoken by a TTS engine.

## Translations

Date / time descriptions can be easily localized. Currently, only a German translation is provided, but new translation can be added without programming skills:
- Get [POEdit](https://poedit.net).
- Use it to open [messages.pot](alarmclock/locale/messages.pot).
- Choose your language and start translating. 
- To test, place the result in `localedir/your_language/LC_MESSAGES/messages.{mp}o`.
- Please share new translations. Thanks!
