### :sparkles: Features
- **:rocket: Fast**: You can download an facebook album of 500 photos in 8 
minutes. If you have a stable network, you can reduce the timeout option to make
it run faster.
- **:package: Minimal**: FAD runs on Firefox driver in Headless mode (without
GUI). In terms of memory and CPU utilizatioon, Firefox is far better and
utilizes few resources compare with Chromium browsers.
- **:beers: Easy To Use**: FAD read its arguments from the command line. If you
are not familiar with CLI (command-line interface), you can create a JSON
configuration file. You can use FAD without programming knowledge.

album of photos.
