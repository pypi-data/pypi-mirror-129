Those certificates are used to activate TLS for end-2-end testing (to be as
close as possible as production environment), they are used in other containers
needing TLS certificates (notably Prosody).

To generate them, minica has been used. Minica can be found at https://github.com/jsha/minica.

The following commands have been used:

$ minica --domains "server1.test,*.server1.test,server2.test,server3.test,libervia-backend.test,libervia-web.test"
$ chmod 0644 minica.pem server1.test/cert.pem && chmod 0640 server1.test/key.pem

Note that certificates are valid for 2 years and 30 days, so they must be renewed after this delay.
