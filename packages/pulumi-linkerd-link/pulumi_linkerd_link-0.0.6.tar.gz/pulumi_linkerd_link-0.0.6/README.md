# Linkerd cluster linkage pulumi provider

This provider is currently experimental. You're welcome to try it &
open issues, but please don't rely on it for production work yet!

## Future plans

I plan to make minor bugfixes as necessary for our use of this provider at
[@MaterializeInc](https://github.com/MaterializeInc).
