# Questionify

**Questionify** is a simple desktop software to help you study. The concept is
simple; fill it with questions you must practice answering, and it helps you
generate a well-balanced list of questions day after day, allowing you to keep
your knowledge sharp.

Initially developed for my own need; made public later under the **GNU GPLv3**
license.
