Research Interests
-------------------
•	Detection of contaminants in water and wastewater [electrochemical nanosensors and biosensors]
•	Data analytic tools [non-linear time series analyses, global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, and hazard quotient assessment]
•	Sustainability Design [tradeoffs across the dimensions of technical, resource recovery, environmental, economic, and social sustainability with techno-economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and multi-criteria decision analysis]


Overview
-------------------
Biography: Dr. Victoria Morgan is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her core research ares focus on integrating sensor development, wastewater treatment and resource recovery design, and decision-support tools to inform sustainable research, development, and deployment of technologies for key stakeholders. She is currently helping lead a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) project to assess and improve the design of sanitation technologies for deployment in resource-limited settings under the supervision of Dr. Jeremy Guest and Dr. Ro Cusick. This work leverages quantitative sustainable design techniques (i.e., techno-economic assessment and life cycle assessment) with context specific scenarios to inform investment opportunities of sanitation technologies. In addition the BMGF work, Dr. Morgan is leading the development of a Python package for decision-making among multiple dimensions of sustainability to guide research and development of sanitation systems (`DMsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/DMsan>`_), using data analytic tools coupled with sensors to improve wastewater treatment efficiency in the U.S., and using quantitative sustainable design to identify viable pathways for technologies removing micropollutants from drinking water. Dr. Morgan’s training includes a B.S. in Biology with minors in business, environmental studies, and mathematics from Millsaps College, and a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Biological from the University of Florida with certificates in Engineering Leadership and Biological Systems Modeling. Her dissertation work used data-driven decision support tools by merging nanosensors, public health risk models (i.e., hazard quotient assessment and global sensitivity uncertainty analysis), and multi-criteria decision analysis to mitigate mercury exposure for marginalized communities in Colombia.
