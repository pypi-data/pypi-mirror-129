        # Overview
        
        Spotify Offline (`spotifyoffline`) is a command line tool that allows one to download Spotify playlists in MP3 format. It is built to serve as a free and open-sourced substitute to Spotify's priced offline streaming.
        
        # Examples
        
        ## Basic Usage
        
        Before downloading music from a Spotify playlist, credentials and the playlist ID must be defined in a YAML configuration/credentials file. An example of this can be found in `credentials.sample.yml`.
        
        Resources for finding the playlist ID can be found [here](https://clients.caster.fm/knowledgebase/110/How-to-find-Spotify-playlist-ID.html) and those for getting the credentials for the Spotify API can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/).
        
        One can begin the download process by running `spotifyoffline <credentials>`, replacing `credentials` with the path to the YAML file.
