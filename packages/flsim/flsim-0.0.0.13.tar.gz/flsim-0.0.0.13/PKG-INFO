Description: Model simulation framework simulates model training under FL setting, primarily
        for ML engineers.
        
        Model simulation framework aims to help ML engineers:
         - quickly train an existing model using FL and compare FL training to conventional training
         - quickly iterate to pick best model architecture and hyper-parameters for FL
        
        At the same time, we want the model simulation framework to ensure:
         - quick training/iteration
         - efficient hyper-parameter tuning (Bayesian search)
         - developer environment familiar to ML engineers/researchers
        
        
        Note that this is different from full-stack simulation (a.k.a. Systems Simulation)
        in "papaya/simulation".
        
        
        Components
         - utils
           Handy functionalities for simulating Federated Learning such as a class that
           can simulate event distribution for async FL
