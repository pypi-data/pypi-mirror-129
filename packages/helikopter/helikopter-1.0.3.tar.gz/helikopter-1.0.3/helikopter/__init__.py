A simple script to print a helicopter animation to the terminal.
The heli_animation.txt file should be in the same folder as this file or else the code won't work

Usage
=====
To run normally use
    python -m helikopter
To specify a custom frame duration use
    python -m helikopter n
Where n is the duration such as 0.5:
    python -m helikopter 0.5
