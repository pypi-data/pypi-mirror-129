See [this video](https://youtu.be/s8DiVcK26fg) or [this page](https://wiki.projecttopics.org/982409-what-is-helicopter-helicopter-meme-viral-tiktok-song-explore/index.html "Meme explanation") for a highly detailed explanation

### The origins
> The helicopter helicopter is a meme that got generated around November of this year.
> According to YouTube, the original video is about five seconds long. The video features a young Arab boy that has placed himself as a seat for the motorbike.
> His face is the headlight while his hands rest on the wheel of the Transformer-like vehicle.
> The serious expression on the boy’s face makes the video even more hilarious.
> The shot clip has managed to gather over 150,000 views in a few short days.
> On TikTok, the sound is famous as Helikopter by Fezlija.

### The creator
> The singer behind the Helikoppter helipkopter meme is none other then Fazlija. He is a 49 year old musician from Bosnia and herzegovinea.
> The singer released the song back in 2015. After a few creators used the tune for their background music, the sound started getting the recognition it deserves.
> It seems that the song has yet to have an English translation. According to Know your meme, the sone is about money and helicopter.
> The youtube videos have about 2 million views.
