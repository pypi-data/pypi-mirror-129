# xstruct

This module provides a solution to serialize, deserialize and represent
packed binary data in a declarative manner. It is built on top and
extends the capabilities of the standard `struct` module while
presenting an higher-level object oriented interface similar to that of
the familiar `@dataclass` decorator. It has optional support for
embedded BSON data structures.
