        Ichs is a module I made for fun in around 20 minutes. As of writing, there are only two functions but I do plan to add more.
        
        # Twitter
        ---
        ```py
        ichs.twitter()
        ```
        Will return Ichs' Twitter page.
        
        Usage:
        ```py
        import ichs
        
        twitter = ichs.twitter()
        print(twitter)
        ```
        ```
        http://www.twitter.com/IlfordCountySch
        ```
        # Website
        ---
        ```py
        ichs.website()
        ```
        Will return the Ichs website.
        
        Usage:
        ```py
        import ichs
        
        website = ichs.website()
        print(website)
