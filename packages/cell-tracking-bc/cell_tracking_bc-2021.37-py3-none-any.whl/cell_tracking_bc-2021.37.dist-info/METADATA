==============================================================

.. _installation:

INSTALLATION
============

The ``cell-tracking-BC`` project is published on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org>`_ at: `https://pypi.org/project/cell-tracking-bc <https://pypi.org/project/cell-tracking-bc>`_. It requires version 3.8, or newer, of the interpreter. It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Otherwise, it can be installed from a command-line console:

- For all users, after acquiring administrative rights:
    - First installation: ``pip3 install cell-tracking-bc``
    - Installation update: ``pip3 install --upgrade cell-tracking-bc``
- For the current user (no administrative rights required):
    - First installation: ``pip3 install --user cell-tracking-bc``
    - Installation update: ``pip3 install --user --upgrade cell-tracking-bc``


.. note::
    The command ``pip3`` was used above to emphasize that ``cell-tracking-BC`` requires major version 3 of Python. If ``pip`` defaults to this version, it can of course be used instead.
