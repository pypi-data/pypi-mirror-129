# sc8pr

An educational programming package for [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org). Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Processing](https://www.processing.org), **sc8pr**â€™s aim is to make it easy for new and experienced Python programmers to create animations, games, and other graphics-based programs.

# Installation

Latest release (2.2b0):
```
pip3 install sc8pr==2.2b0
```

Bug fixes for v2.1:
```
pip3 install https://github.com/dmaccarthy/sc8pr/archive/BugFix-2.1.zip
```

Development version (2.2.x):
```
pip3 install https://github.com/dmaccarthy/sc8pr/archive/master.zip
```

Please note that currently (2021 October 6), **pygame 1.9** is available on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) up to Python 3.8 only. Attempting to install an older version of **sc8pr** in Python 3.9 may fail as the **pygame** requirement is unavailable. For Python 3.9, you can use the most recent **sc8pr** versions (2.1.4, 2.2.b0) that accept **pygame 2.0** OR **1.9** as a requirement.

See the documentation for more [detailed instructions](https://dmaccarthy.github.io/sc8pr/?inst).

# Try It First

**sc8pr** is pure Python 3 code, so you can try it without running the setup. Just unzip the **sc8pr** package into your PYTHONPATH. You will still need **pygame 1.9** or **2.0** installed for current **sc8pr** versions and **pygame 1.9** for older versions.
