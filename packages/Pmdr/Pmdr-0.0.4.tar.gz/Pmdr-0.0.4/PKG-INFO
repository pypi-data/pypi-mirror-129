Pmdr - CLI pomodoro timer.

The following command:

```
doro start
```

Will give you a classic Pomodoro timer with 4 Pomodoros(25min of Focus followed by a 5 min break), and after 4, you shall get a Longer break of 30min.

With the following command:

```cmd
doro start -bs --breaks
```

You can set the number of long breaks needed to complete your tasks!

The following Command:

```cmd
doro custom
```

Can be used to build out your own timer how you see fit.
The following flags can be used to build your own custom pomodoro timer setup.

```python
-f --focus # Focus time, default 25min
-s --short # Break time after every Focus time, default 5min
-l --long # Long break, default 25min
-bs --breaks # Number of long breaks to take, default 4
```

Pmdr also comes with a few quick timers for ease of use:

```python
doro hour # minute timer

doro half # 30 minute timer
```

You can also set a custom timer with the following command:

```cmd
doro timer -m --minutes
```
