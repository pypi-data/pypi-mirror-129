# 🥪 Dinject

**Dinject** is a Python package and CLI tool for executing code blocks in Markdown documents then injecting the results.

<edition value="toc" />

## Example

This example creates a Markdown document with a code block and an injection site, then performs the injection:

~~~python
from dinject import inject
from io import StringIO

markdown = """This is a demonstration of Dinject.

```bash
python --version
```

<!--dinject-->
"""

writer = StringIO()

inject(markdown, writer)

print(writer.getvalue())
~~~

In the output, the injection site has been replaced by the execution result:

<!--edition-exec as=markdown fence=tildes host=shell range=start-->

~~~text
This is a demonstration of Dinject.

```bash
python --version
```

<!--dinject as=markdown fence=backticks host=shell range=start-->

```text
Python 3.10.0
```

<!--dinject range=end-->
~~~

<!--edition-exec range=end-->

**Fun fact!** The documentation you're reading right now was generated by [Edition](https://github.com/cariad/edition) which uses Dinject under the hood. The example output above was generated and injected by Dinject executing the code block preceding it.

## Installation

Dinject requires Python 3.8 or later.

Install Dinject via pip:

```bash
pip install dinject
```

## Injection attributes

The most basic injection site is simply:

```markdown
<!--dinject-->
```

To fence the injection with tildes instead of backticks (for example, if you're embedding Markdown within Markdown) then set the `fence` attribute:

```markdown
<!--dinject fence=tildes-->
```

To inject the result as HTML instead of Markdown (for example, to render the colours and other styles in the command's output) then set the `as` attribute:

```markdown
<!--dinject as=html-->
```

To have the code executed in a pseudo terminal rather than a sub shell (for example, if the command emits formatted output only in non-interactive shells) then set the `host` attribute:

```markdown
<!--dinject host=terminal-->
```

## Command line usage

Run `dinject` and pass paths to Markdown documents to update:

```bash
dinject README.md docs/example.md
```

## Python usage

### Injection

The `inject()` function takes:

- A reader, which can be a text stream or a string.
- A text stream writer.
- An optional parser.

### Custom parsers

A customised `Parser` can be passed into `inject()` to tweak some runtime configuration.

The `keyword` describes the injection site keyword. This is "dinject" by default. If you wanted to injection sites to be marked up by, say, `<!--foo-->` then set the keyword to "foo".

## Languages

### Bash

Dinject executes Bash code blocks via `/usr/bin/env bash -c CODE`.

This will require a Linux-like operating system or operating system layer.

### Python

Dinject executes Bash code blocks via `python -c CODE`.

The first Python interpreter available in your path will be used; this includes your virtual environment if you're in one. Dinject will rely on that interpreter/virtual environment to perform the imports.

### Text

Text blocks will be passed-through unchanged.
