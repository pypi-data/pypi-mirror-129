# matrix-photos
This aims to be a simple [matrix](https://matrix.org/) client for the photOS DIY photoframe.

Matrix is an open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication.

For photOS please checkout https://github.com/avanc/photOS for more information.

This client can be used to transfer pictures to the photoframe with end to end encryption support.
The idea is, that trusted users just can create a matrix room and invite the photoframe matrix user.
The photoframe user will automatically join this room and download all pictures send to this room.
