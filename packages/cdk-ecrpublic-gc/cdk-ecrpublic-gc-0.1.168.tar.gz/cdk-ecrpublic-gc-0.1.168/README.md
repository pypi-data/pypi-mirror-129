# cdk-ecrpublic-gc

CDK construct library that helps you build a garbage collector to delete all untagged images in Amazon ECR public with AWS CDK.

# Why

Amazon ECR public does not have lifecycle policy to clean up all untagged images at this moment(see [this issue](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1268)). `cdk-ecrpublic-gc` allows you to deploy a **AWS Step Functions** state machine with [dynamic parallelism](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/blogs/aws/new-step-functions-support-for-dynamic-parallelism/) to invoke an arbitrary of Lambda functions to remove untagged images to release the storage.

# Schedule

By default, the state machine will be triggered **every 4 hours** and can be configured in the `schedule` property in the `TidyUp` construct.

# Sample

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
import aws_cdk.core as cdk
from cdk_ecrpublic_gc import TidyUp

app = cdk.App()

stack = cdk.Stack(app, "ecr-public-gc")

TidyUp(stack, "TidyUp",
    repository=["vscode", "gitpod-workspace", "github-codespace"
    ],
    schedule=events.Schedule.cron(hour="*/4", minute="0")
)
```

# In Action

Step Function state machine with dynamic tasks in parallel
