## Contribute
Feel free to send pull requests. I will ensure I get back to you so long as this repo hasn't gone cold.

## How to use
You can pull this repo down using github desktop or git then use it like a normal package or extract functions you want to use. Eventually I plan on adding pip support but sadly that is not available right now.

## Contact
I am available through Github occasionally but if you want a possibly faster dialogue go for discord.
My discord currently is @Irregular_Decagon_Prism#1336 on the PnW discord.
