"""A Preprocessor packages(on-device) the input pipeline specific preprocessing.
The key benefit to appending a Preprocessor Layer to a model is that it makes
your model portable. When all data preprocessing is part of the model, other
people can load and use your model without having to be aware of how each
feature is expected to be encoded & normalized. Your inference model will be
able to process raw images or raw structured data, and will not require users of
the model to be aware of the details of e.g. the tokenization scheme used for
text, the indexing scheme used for categorical features, whether image pixel
values are normalized to [-1, +1] or to [0, 1], etc. This is especially powerful
if you're exporting your model to another runtime, such as TensorFlow.js: you
won't have to reimplement your preprocessing pipeline in JavaScript.

If you initially put your preprocessing layers in your tf.data pipeline, you can
export an inference model that packages the preprocessing. Simply instantiate
a new model that chains your preprocessing layers and your training model.

Crucially, these layers are non-trainable. Their state is not set during
training; it must be set before training, a step called "adaptation".
