Adds the RJD time format for use by Astropy's `Time` object.
Caution: AstroPy time objects make a distinction between a time's format
(e.g. ISO, JD, MJD) and its scale (e.g. UTC, TDB).
Note: the classes below derive from an AstroPy meta class which
will automatically register the formats for use in AstroPy Time objects.
